# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
One of the options to prevent the ssh brute force attack is to only allow ssh access from specific IP address or a range of IP address.
Admin can define a range of IP addresses from AWS console. Furthermore, not all instances should be allowed for ssh access.
For current app setup all instances have ssh port open which a security vulnaribility.

Another method would be to enable ssh access for only one instance and install a brute force blocker app.
This instance can be configured as NAT instance and instances in private subnets can connect to the internet through NAT instance.

The final method could be to diable ssh access from the internet and instead use AWS's VPN or DirectLink options
to access the cloud. Although this could be a very expensive option, it would be one of the safest options.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
Secret recipes bucket can be configured with appropriate BucketPolicy to allow access only from certain
resources. For instance, it can be configured to disable access from the internet and from the subnets that 
web server and attacker instance are deployed. This way we could secure this bucket from compromised acccess.
