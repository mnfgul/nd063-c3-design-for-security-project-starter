Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
API credentials have been used to access the S3 bucket; however, this is a bad security practice. Instead of enabling API access from web servers to S3 bucket, IAM roles could be used to access the bucket. This would allow web server instances to assume role intead of having access through API credentials.

# Poor practice 2
Public web servers should not have access to the S3 bucket, intead an application servers instance could be launched in private subnet which will be used as gateway of securing access to other resources. This way the web server will be able to communicate with app server in private subnet, however, an attacker could not access to this instance.
